X = [last log we processed]
Y = X + [most logs we can skip] - 1
J = NULL
for (I = Y; I > X; I++)
	if exists (I) on keymaster
		J = I
next I

If J is not NULL
	if (datepart(day, J)) > (datepart(day, X))
		run daily.pl and wait for it to finish
			(daily.pl must clear out daytables when finished)
	endif

	copy J from keymaster to tally
	unzip J (Abort with error if unzip fails)
	preprocess J (cut blockid column)
	bcp in J
	SQL to move J into holding tables
	write J as X
	goto top (is there another log waiting?)
endif
wait for next scheduled run

# Comments / Questions

OK, I basically scrubbed the above.  Since the logfiles live on another machine,
on the other side of the net, it's much quicker and probably saner to just treat
the "look at the logs dir" operation as atomic.

Current code grabs a directory listing of the logs dir on the master and works
from that.  loops from "lastlog+1" to "highest log present" and pulls the lowest
qualifying log found.

code assumes existence of ~/var/

Only moderately tested at this point.  Handles obvious exceptions.
