GETTING STARTED
You will need a stats database to run from. See stats-sql/build.

In global, copy statsconf.pm.default to statsconf.pm.

%logsource: where your log files can be found.

RUNNING hourly.pl
hourly/hourly.pl is responsible for running daily/daily.pl. misc/hourly.sh is a
convenient wrapper for hourly.pl that can go into your crontab. Until you know
everything is setup correctly you'll want to run hourly.pl manually; ie:

cd stats-proc/hourly && ./hourly.pl ~/workdir

Once stat-proc is working you can get stats-html setup.

RUNNING BY HAND
Occasionally you might need to do a daily run by hand. daily/runday* will do this.
You can also restore data from a previous day's run using daily/backout.sh. You can
also rebuild all the 'secondary' tables using stats-sql/recovery/rebuild.
