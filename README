stats-rc5 is non-live, non-production code and is slated to be Attic'd
very soon.

"daily" is intended to be the new cross-project daily processing code and
will be made production code as soon as it can handle ogr and rc5 stats.

In a production environment, you'll need to add some symlinks to the daily
directory for it to function properly.

The old csc dir had the following, this will obviouslyu need to be tweaked
somewhat:

   incoming -> /home/incoming/newlogs-csc
   stalelogs -> ../stale-csc/

should symlink a workdir someplace, too.
