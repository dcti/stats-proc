X = [last log we processed]
Y = X + [most logs we can skip] - 1
J = NULL
for (I = Y; I > X; I++)
	if exists (I) on keymaster
		J = I
next I

If J is not NULL
	if (datepart(day, J)) > (datepart(day, X))
		run daily.pl and wait for it to finish
			(daily.pl must clear out daytables when finished)
	endif

	copy J from keymaster to tally
	unzip J (Abort with error if unzip fails)
	preprocess J (cut blockid column)
	bcp in J
	SQL to move J into holding tables
	write J as X
	goto top (is there another log waiting?)
endif
wait for next scheduled run

# Comments / Questions

- Where do we intend to store "X"?  in sql or in a work file?
  If we're placing it in sql, how should that be handled?  Is it time
  for a projectinfo table?  (could possibly assume some of the work
  being done by Stats.pm)
