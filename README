*** How to run daily stats ***
You will want to run ~decibel/stats-proc/daily/runday, which is a dumb
sh script. Take note of the output at the end from audit.sql!! If it flags
any errors then something is definitely wrong! After you've verified that
the run progressed as expected, you want to run
~decibel/stats-proc/daily/runday2


*** NOTICE: IMPORTANT CHANGE  ***

./global/ is completely re-worked and this *will* break existing 
installations.  Brief summary of effective changes:

  o stats.pm no longer needs to live in the perl default @INC path
  o stats.pm has been split, configuration info now lives in the
    statsconf.pm file
  o statsconf.pm is NOT part of the cvs repository.  Rather, there's
    a statsconf.pm.default file which shows you what needs to be
    placed in the live file for proper operation.

These changes were made in order to remove sensitive information from
the live scripts.  (i.e. -- statsproc login id and password).  

After cvs upping, you'll need to cp ./global/statsconf.pm.default to
./global/statsconf.pm and edit the sqlserver, sqllogin, and sqlpasswd
lines for statproc login info.

*** YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED :) ***

stats-rc5 is non-live, non-production code and is slated to be Attic'd
very soon.

"daily" is intended to be the new cross-project daily processing code and
will be made production code as soon as it can handle ogr and rc5 stats.

In a production environment, you'll need to add some symlinks to the daily
directory for it to function properly.

The old csc dir had the following, this will obviouslyu need to be tweaked
somewhat:

   incoming -> /home/incoming/newlogs-csc
   stalelogs -> ../stale-csc/

should symlink a workdir someplace, too.

There was a "backup" directory which I committed and immediately threw
into the attic.
