make sure indexes are correct
modify scripts that create tables to delete them if they already exist
error checking

modify filter.pl to validate email addresses (?)
modify filter.pl to validate other fields (?)

create filter script for id_lookup to escape bad chars

instead of recreating summary table every day, be smart and only add
  the work that has been done that day.
